## Why GatherSpace?

GatherSpace redefines how teams collaborate remotely by making interactions feel more natural and less rigid. Instead of scheduled meetings, users can walk up to each other, say hi, and start a conversation. Whether you’re looking for spontaneous chats or structured meetings, GatherSpace transforms the way you work from anywhere.

4.	Custom Rooms: Admins can create and customize rooms for different teams or purposes, giving each space a unique feel.
